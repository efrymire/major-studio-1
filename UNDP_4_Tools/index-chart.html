                    The September 2015 adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable
                    Development Goals (SDGs) has drawn considerable attention to income inequality in sub-Saharan
                    Africa (SSA). To achieve the goal of "leaving no one behind" by 2030, the UNDP Regional Bureau
                    for Africa feels very strongly that inequality levels, trends, determinants and consequences in
                    the region must be documented properly.

                    The basic structural drivers of inequality can be divided into three groups: <br><br> 
                    
                    (i) the highly
                    dualistic economic structure, with limited employment of the labour elite in the government,
                    multinational companies (MNCs) and the resource sector, whereas the majority of labour earns
                    much lower incomes in the informal or subsistence sector; <br>
                        
                    (ii) the high concentration of physical
                    capital, human capital and land, especially in the economies of East and Southern Africa, in
                    certain groups or regions; <br> and (iii) the limited distributive capacity of the state, which often
                    manifests in the "natural resource curse", the urban bias of public policy and ethnic and gender
                    inequalities.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    This project aims to explore both (i) and (iii) by visualizing the relationship between gender inequality 
                    and income inequality in Africa. The metrics used to construct this data visualization include a
                    breakdown of the Gender Inequality Index and the Gini coefficient.

                            The Gender Inequality Index (GII) measures gender inequalities in three important aspects of human
                            development-reproductive health, measured by maternal mortality ratio and adolescent birth rates;
                            empowerment, measured by proportion of parliamentary seats occupied by females and proportion of
                            adult females and males aged 25 years and older with at least some secondary education; and
                            economic status, expressed as labour market participation and measured by labour force
                            participation rate of female and male populations aged 15 years and older.

                            The Gini Coefficient is used to measure a country's inequality by comparing distribution of income.
                            Inequality on the Gini scale is measured between 0, a score which would suggest that everybody is
                            be equal, and 1, a score which would suggest that all the country's income is earned by a single
