                    <i>The September 2015 adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable
                    Development Goals (SDGs) has drawn considerable attention to income inequality in sub-Saharan
                    Africa (SSA). To achieve the goal of "leaving no one behind" by 2030, the UNDP Regional Bureau
                    for Africa feels very strongly that inequality levels, trends, determinants and consequences in
                    the region must be documented properly. <br><br>

                    The basic structural drivers of inequality can be divided into three groups: <br> 
                    
                    (i) the highly
                    dualistic economic structure, with limited employment of the labour elite in the government,
                    multinational companies (MNCs) and the resource sector, whereas the majority of labour earns
                    much lower incomes in the informal or subsistence sector; <br>
                        
                    (ii) the high concentration of physical
                    capital, human capital and land, especially in the economies of East and Southern Africa, in
                    certain groups or regions; <br> 
                    
                    and (iii) the limited distributive capacity of the state, which often
                    manifests in the "natural resource curse", the urban bias of public policy and ethnic and gender
                    inequalities.

                    <br><br>
                    This project aims to explore both (i) and (iii) by visualizing the relationship between gender inequality 
                    and income inequality in Africa. The metrics used to construct this data visualization include a
                    breakdown of the Gender Inequality Index and the Gini coefficient. More information, including context, code,

                            The Gender Inequality Index (GII) measures gender inequalities 
                            in three important aspects of human development-reproductive health, 
                            measured by maternal mortality ratio and adolescent birth rates; empowerment, 
                            measured by proportion of parliamentary seats occupied by females and proportion 
                            of adult females and males aged 25 years and older with at least some secondary 
                            education; and economic status, expressed as labour market participation and 
                            measured by labour force participation rate of female and male populations 
                            aged 15 years and older. A value of 0 represents perfect equality, while an 
                            index of 100 implies perfect inequality.
                        
                        </div>

                        <div class='col-md-12 col-sm-12 header'>What is the Gini Coefficient?</div>

                            As stated by the World Bank, the Gini index measures the extent to which the 
                            distribution of income among individuals or households deviates from a perfectly 
                            equal distribution. A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total 
                            income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the 
                            poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between the 
                            Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a 
                            percentage of the maximum area under the line. Similar to GII, a value of 0 
                            represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.

                    Ayodele states in Income Inequality Trends in Sub-Saharan Africa that as the economic 
                    status of women improves, so does the economic status of entire families. This 
                    visualization intends to show clear relationships between gender and income inequality, 
                    as well as educate the user on the calculation of male and female indexes. By 
                    understanding the impact of gender equality on income equality, and the difference 
                    in male and female indexes, we can work to raise female indexes, thus lowering gender 
                    and income inequality.

                    This visualization includes a comparison of GII and GINI as well as male and female 
                    indexes. As stated above, male and female indexes are used to calculate the GII. The 
                    circles are placed on top of a grey outline. The black circle represents the GII value, 
                    while the red circle represents the GINI value. In the related view, the black circle 
                    represents the male index, and the red circle indicates the female index.
