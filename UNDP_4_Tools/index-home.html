                "While labour market and educational system challenges contribute to inequality, gender disparities within these institutions are an important source of inequality in Africa. The UNDP's Gender Inequality Index is a composite measure that reflects inequality in achievement between men and women in three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment and the labour market, where the lower the score, the closer the gender parity." - UNDP Income Inequality Trends in Sub-Saharan Africa.

            <div class='col-sm-5 col-md-4'> GII: The GII is an inequality index. It measures gender inequalities in three important aspects of human 
            development: reproductive health, measured by maternal mortality ratio and adolescent birth rates; empowerment, measured by proportion of 
            parliamentary seats occupied by females and proportion of adult females and males aged 25 years and older with at least some secondary education; 
            and economic status, expressed as labour market participation and measured by labour force participation rate of female and male populations 
            aged 15 years and older.
            <br></br>
            Equality among genders is represented by a score of 0. A "good" score is as close to 0 as possible. The GII coefficient is represented in black in the proceeding chart. 

            </div>
            
            <div class='col-sm-5 col-md-4'>GINI: The Gini coefficient is used to measure a country's inequality by comparing distribution of income. 
            Inequality on the Gini scale is measured between 0, a score which would suggest that everybody is be equal, and 1, a score which would suggest that all the country's income is earned by a single person.
            <br></br>
            Similar to the GII score, a country should aim to minimize the Gini coefficient. A "good" score is as close to 0 as possible. The Gini coefficient is represented in red in the proceeding chart.
