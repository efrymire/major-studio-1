### Project Details

This github page is Ellie Frymire's submission for a Major Studio project entitled "Dynamics, Interactivity and Narrative". This exercise adds interaction and UI principles to the qualitative and quantitative dimensions already investigated in this class. 
The objective of this assignment is as follows:

* Revisit your quantitative assignment and assess its relation to your subject domain you have chosen.
* Iterate your quantitative assignment by adding navigation, interactivity, and UI principles to  enrich the experience and strengthen your design in response to your initial research question.
* Articulate your subject domain through a title, caption, and contextual information (including sources)

### Project Approach

To accomplish this proejct, I revisited my first project with quantitative information. I had 
illustrated gini coefficients and their associated Q1/Q5 values through bar charts. To build on the 
effectiveness of seeing the gini score, and tying in my subject of gender, I created a comparison
of gini coefficient and gender inequality index for each country. The details of these two values are 
listed in the home page of the assignment.
