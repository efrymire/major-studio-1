### About the Course
#### PGDV 5200

This course teaches students the fundamentals of data visualization so that they 
can design solutions for a wide range of contemporary data visualization scenarios. 
Students will learn the fundamentals of data visualization programming tools 
necessary to complete their projects in this studio course as well as the 
communication skills to collaborate with programmers and social scientists in 
professional contexts. Throughout the course students will look at historic and 
contemporary design precedents, understand where data comes from, explore data to 
find meaningful communication themes, and consider the privacy and social 
responsibility aspects of the work. Additionally, students will explore how to 
successfully and critically apply their skills of communication design to data 
visualization and information aesthetics.

### About the Final Project
#### Circle of Equality

The final project is an exploration of the Gini coefficient and Gender Inequality 
Index as outlined by the UNDP.

This data visualization compares both male and female gender indexes to easily 
visualize the gender gap. By including the Gini coefficient, we can easily 
explore how inequality between genders relates to income inequality.

Using small multiples, the user can compare both gender and income inequality 
accross Africa and sort by the elements that comprise gender inequality, the 
overall gender inequality index for that country, and the gini coefficient.
