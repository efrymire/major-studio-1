### About the Course
#### PGDV 5200

This course teaches students the fundamentals of data visualization so that they 
can design solutions for a wide range of contemporary data visualization scenarios. 
Students will learn the fundamentals of data visualization programming tools 
necessary to complete their projects in this studio course as well as the 
communication skills to collaborate with programmers and social scientists in 
professional contexts. Throughout the course students will look at historic and 
contemporary design precedents, understand where data comes from, explore data to 
find meaningful communication themes, and consider the privacy and social 
responsibility aspects of the work. Additionally, students will explore how to 
successfully and critically apply their skills of communication design to data 
visualization and information aesthetics.

### About the Final Project
#### Exploring Equality

The final project is an exploration of the Gini coefficient and Gender Inequality 
Index as outlined by the UNDP. The text *Income Inequality Trends in 
Sub-Saharan Africa* states that as the economic 
status of women improves, so does the economic status of entire families. This 
visualization intends to show clear relationships between gender and income inequality, 
as well as educate the user on the calculation of male and female indexes. By 
understanding the impact of gender equality on income equality, and the difference 
in male and female indexes, we can work to raise female indexes, thus lowering gender 
and income inequality.
