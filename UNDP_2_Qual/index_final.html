      <h2>Exploring the relationship between the constitution and gender inequality</h2>
      <p>
      Gender inequality is a problem all over the word. Regardless of the 
      provisions of legal systems, gender inequality was and is rooted in social 
      and religious norms on women's rights to land, inheritance, marriage, 
      division of labour, access to education, credit, employment and participation 
      in social and political life. For instance, while Kenya's Constitution outlaws 
      gender discrimination, it also upholds gender-biased customary law on marriage, 
      divorce and inheritance.
      <br><br>
      But are any other constitutions structured like Kenya's constitution? Could 
      language within a constitution have any affect on gender inequality? To explore this 
      further, I looked into word frequency for the words "people", "man" and "woman" within
      the constitutions of Ghana, Kenya, and Burkina Faso.
      <br><br>
      To the right, roll your mouse over the country to display its word frequency results. The more 
      frequent words are larger and closer to the top of the graph. 
      Ghana and Kenya have more progressive GII (0.547 and 0.565 respectively),
      and their constitutions both include the words
      "man" or "woman" or "person" more often, which appear as full white text in the graph. 
      Burkina Faso, with a GII rating of 0.615, doesn't 
      have much emphasis on "person" at all - its almost hard to see in the graph. To illustrate 
      more interesting findings, I've removed articles such as "the", "and", "so", "a", etc.
